        <h2> The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan & Brandon Sanderson</h2>
        <p>I started reading <i>The Wheel of Time</i> 7 or so years ago. At the begining of this year I decided to  
          finish them.  There are 14 books in total and during the quarantine I listened
          to 4 of them. The author Robert Jordan died before he could finish; Brandon Sanderson wrote the 
          last 3.

        <h2> Smoke Bitten by Patrica Briggs </h2>
        <p> Book #12 is the Mercy Thompson Series, realeased during quarantine. Patrica Briggs is one
          of my favorite auothors. I started reading these books when they were first published and look
          forward to each book. Patrica Briggs has a way of writing new story lines that feel like old 
          friends.

        <h2> Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman</h2>
        <p> 
          I read this book for a book club. The website that recommended it said it was light
          hearted... I wouldn't say that it was light and fluffy. It was an interesting read
          that helped me escape my own head.
